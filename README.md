# âš¡ Electric Field Simulation

It is my first web-based interactive simulation built with Three.js that visualizes electric fields due to point charges, charge interactions, and field lines in real-time. It's designed to be visually smooth and educational. I'm using this project to supplement my self-studying in electromagnetics by putting the concepts I'm learning into interactive simulations.

## Features

* **Point Charge Visualization** - Charges can be rendered as colored glows (red for positive, blue for negative) with smooth falloff.

*  **Dynamic Electric Field Lines** - Real-time field line tracing using Runge-Kutta method based on the current configuration of charges.

*  **Charge Interaction** - Add or remove point charges and change their charge values dynamically. Charges update the field in real-time.

##  Tech Stack

* **Three.js** â€“ Core 3D rendering and scene management.
* **JavaScript (ES6)** â€“ Logic, controls, and UI interactions.
* **HTML/CSS** â€“ Basic layout and style.

##  Physics Behind the Scenes

* Coulomb's Law:
  
  $\displaystyle \vec{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \sum_i \frac{q_i(\vec{r} - \vec{r}_i)}{|\vec{r} - \vec{r}_i|^3}$

* Field lines follow $\vec{E}$, traced via Runge-Kutta calculation of the differential equation
  
  $\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{E_y}{E_x}$
